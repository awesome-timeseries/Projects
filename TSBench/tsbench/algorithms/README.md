### base.py
base.py is a template for your own algorithm. You need to read it in details before writing your awesome algorithm. 

### parameters.json
Specially, the parameter filename in constructor function is useless unless you need to customize algorithm parameters for every single timeseries data. For example, as you can see, there is a "parameters.json" in sorad detector. This means you can freely adjust super parameters to improve the performace of your algorithm.But in knncad detector, I don't include "parameters.json" as I simply want to use unified parameters for all timeseries data.To sum up
"parameters.json" is not compulsory but optional.It all depends on your algorithm.
